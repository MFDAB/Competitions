# Worldskills Singapore 2023: Mechatronics

This repository documents the preparation and execution of the **Mechatronics** competition during **Worldskills Singapore 2023**. Representing **Nanyang Polytechnic** from the **Diploma in Electronic & Computer Engineering**, this project showcases the assembly, programming, and commissioning of complex industrial automation systems.

## 🎯 Competition Objective

The primary goal was to **assemble and commission** a Modular Production System (MPS) in the shortest time possible while adhering to all functional and technical requirements.

## 🛠 Technical Stack & Hardware

The competition utilized industrial-grade equipment and software to simulate real-world production environments:

* 
**PLC:** Panasonic FP7 PLC.


* 
**Programming Language:** Ladder diagrams and graph sets for pre-programming.


* 
**Hardware:** Modular Production System (MPS).


* 
**Interface:** Human Machine Interface (HMI) for machine control and monitoring.


* 
**Connectivity:** Netgear EN100, Ethernet hubs, and PC integration.



### MPS Stations

The system comprised seven distinct stations that required individual and collective integration:

1. 
**Distribution Station**.


2. 
**Measuring Station**.


3. 
**Process Station**.


4. 
**Handling Station**.


5. 
**Pick and Place Station**.


6. 
**Fluid Muscle Station**.


7. 
**Sorting Station**.

## 📅 Competition Schedule

The event was structured over four days at Nanyang Polytechnic (NP):

* 
**Day 0:** Arena setup, unpacking MPS stations, and equipment testing.


* 
**Day 1:** Initial assembly, commissioning, and re-programming tasks (3 hours each).


* 
**Day 2:** Working with unknown stations and components, followed by reprogramming.


* 
**Day 3:** Reverting the MPS to original specifications and final commissioning.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

Performances were scored out of a **total of 60 points** across several categories:

| Category | Maximum Points |
| --- | --- |
| **Function (PLC Program)** | 25 Points 

 |
| **Commissioning (Sorting Station)** | 15 Points 

 |
| **Assembly Section** | 10 Points 

 |
| **Time Evaluation** | 10 Points 

 |

### Time Points Calculation

Time points were awarded only if functional and assembly requirements were met, using the following formula:

## 🧠 Personal Strategy & Reflections

* 
**Team Synergy:** Adopted a strategy of helping partners with the physical build before focusing on individual programming tasks.


* 
**Challenges:** Managed high-stress situations involving unfamiliar products, remembering specific I/O ports, and program retention under pressure.


* 
**Growth:** Emphasized the importance of drawing graph sets manually before transferring them to the computer and seeking "unknown" products from coaches during training.
