# AR Recycling Game: Monitoring Carbon Footprint 🌍

Developed for the **Singapore-India Hackathon (SIH)**, this project addresses the global carbon footprint crisis by transforming traditional waste management into an immersive, gamified experience. By leveraging **Augmented Reality (AR)**, the application educates consumers and incentivizes sustainable behavior to reduce the environmental impact of residential waste.

##  The Problem

* **Global Climate Crisis:** Increasing carbon footprints contribute to extreme weather, droughts, and storms.
* **Engagement Gap:** Traditional recycling information is often viewed as "boring" or uninteresting, leading to improper waste sorting.
* **Government Responsibility:** Governments face heavy financial burdens from carbon taxes, which rise significantly over time (e.g., set to reach **$170 per tonne** in Canada by 2030).



##  Key Features

* **AR Waste Instructor:** Users scan QR codes on product packaging (e.g., shoe boxes or beverage containers) to trigger animated cartoon characters that provide step-by-step recycling instructions.
  
* **Proof of Action:** Players gain points by taking a photo of their successful recycling action as instructed by the game.
* **Social Leaderboards:** Users compete against friends and global players, pushing for higher ranks to earn exclusive rewards.
* **Comprehensive Education:** The game covers a wide range of topics, including composting and hazardous waste disposal.


##  Impact & Sustainability

* **Carbon Savings:** Every ton of waste diverted from landfills results in approximately **3 metric tons** of carbon dioxide equivalent savings.
* **Tax Reduction:** By encouraging widespread recycling, the application helps governments reduce the carbon tax they pay on landfill emissions.
* **Market Appeal:** The interactive nature of AR specifically captures the attention of the tech-savvy younger generation, building long-term brand loyalty for eco-friendly initiatives.


##  Incentives & Partnerships

The game encourages continued engagement through two main reward streams:

1. **Consumer Discounts:** Collaborations with eco-friendly companies like **The Body Shop**, **Ben & Jerry’s**, and **IKEA** to offer product discounts upon reaching game milestones.


2. **Environmental Donations:** Achieving milestones can trigger corporate donations to organizations like the **Arbor Day Foundation** (supporting projects like Team Trees or Team Seas).


## Project Roadmap & Distribution

* **Platform:** Available worldwide via the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play Store**.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Estimated development cost of **$20k**, with potential for profit recovery through in-game advertisements and corporate-sponsored characters.
