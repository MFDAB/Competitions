# Shore Guard: A Smart, Sustainable Coastal Protection Measure

**Shore Guard** is an award-winning project developed for **HPCIC 2024** by a multidisciplinary team from **Nanyang Polytechnic**. It leverages bio-mimicry, advanced material science, and real-time simulations to combat coastal erosion without compromising local ecosystems.

## 🌊 The Problem
Coastal erosion is a critical threat to human development. Existing solutions often fall short:

* **Hard Protection:** High costs and detrimental impacts on the environment.
* **Soft Protection:** Long lead times and potentially destructive methods like beach nourishment.



## 🌱 Our Solution

Shore Guard mimics the natural coastal protection of **mangrove trees**. The system consists of artificial trees acting as nodes for a "smart" root network that anchors coastal sediment and absorbs wave energy.

### Core Technology

* **Intelligent Root System:** Encased in an elastic, biocompatible sheath, these roots contain **Nitinol expansion and contraction coils**. This allows the roots to be shaped in any direction or angle within a 3D Cartesian plane.
* **Variable Weight & Absorption:** Once positioned, roots are filled with a **non-Newtonian fluid** (e.g., Oobleck) to provide weight and enhance energy absorption properties. This fluid can be pumped out to reconfigure the system as needed.
* **Digital Twin Simulation:** We utilize the **Unreal Game Engine** and drone-captured **YOLO/LIDAR** data to generate a 3D simulation ground for erosion analysis.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Simulation:** Unreal Engine 5, Physics Engine 
* **AI/Vision:** YOLO (Object Detection), LIDAR/ToF Depth Scanning 
* **Hardware Logic:** Nitinol SMA (Shape Memory Alloy) Control 
* **Data Science:** Topographical and ecological data preprocessing
